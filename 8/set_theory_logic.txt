writing each digit as a set containing its illuminated segments:

- digits 1, 4, 7, 8 are found by the  unique length of the set
1 has length  2
4 has length 4
7 has length 3
8 has length 7


- then, taking the set difference of digits 1 & 8, we find this difference is a subset ONLY of the digit 6. This identifies digit 6.

- from the remaining sets, only the digit 0 has a set length of 6, this identifies the digit 0.

- then, taking the set difference of the digits 6 and 4, we find this is a subset of digits 0 and 2. But we already identified 0, so this means we have now identified digit 2.

- Then, taking the set intersection of digits 4 & 2, we find it is a subset of all remaining unidentified digits except for 5. Thus we have found digit 5

- Finally, the union of digits 2 & 5 is only a subset of digit 3. This identifies digit 3 and we now know all the digits.


-- version 2, had icon of 9 wrong! --

- digits 1, 4, 7, 8 are found by the  unique length of the set
1 has length  2
4 has length 4
7 has length 3
8 has length 7


- then, taking the set difference of digits 1 & 8, we find this difference is a subset ONLY of the digit 6. This identifies digit 6.

- taking the intersection of digits 6 & 1, this is only NOT a subset of digit 2

- digit 1 is only NOT a subset of digit 5
